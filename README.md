# QM/MM Modelling of Enzyme Reactions

## Aimed at: 
Anyone interested in starting to use QM/MM simulations for their research, in particular for enzyme reactions.

## Requirements: 
Basic knowledge of the Linux command line.

## Abstract: 
The training workshop will introduce non-specialists to the use of combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods for modelling enzyme-catalysed reaction mechanisms. Concepts and techniques of QM/MM reaction modelling will be explained through hands-on exercises. During the tutorial, each participant will generate and analyse an energy profile for the reaction catalysed by chorismate mutase.

## Training Material

The workshop consists of a series of scripts. These are available
below, and can be run using the 
<a href="https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/bristol2018/server.html" target="_blank">workshop jupyter server</a>.

Once you have started the server open a Terminal and change into the `qmmm_workshop` directory. You will find the workshop files there.
