You will calculate a free energy profile and a potential energy profile for the reaction, and analyse an important interaction in the active site.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using the simulation software from the <a href=\"http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php\">AmberTools package</a>. The *sander* programme is capable of the QM/MM simulations required. For efficiency, the semi-empirical QM method PM6 will be used throughout (implemented directly in sander). You can further use <a href=\"http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/\">VMD</a> to visualise the simulations on your local machine (after downloading the final files).\n",

    "You will be simulating the enzyme-catalysed reaction of chorismate to prephenate. This is an intramolecular reaction. The reaction proceeds via a cyclic transition state. A (geometric) reaction coordinate can be defined as the difference between the length of the C-O bond that is breaking, and the length of the C-C bond that is forming. Plotting the energy of the molecule as a function of this reaction coordinate returns a reaction energy profile.\n",
